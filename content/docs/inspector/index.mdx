## Installation

You can start the Muppet MCP Inspector using the `muppet-kit` command line tool.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} label='Start the Inspector'>

```bash tab="npm"
npm muppet-kit inspector
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm muppet-kit inspector
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn muppet-kit inspector
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun muppet-kit inspector
```

</Tabs>

You can also create a config file to customize the Inspector's behavior. Create a file named `muppet.config.js` in your project root with the following content:

```ts
import { defineInspectorConfig } from "muppet-kit";
import { cloudflare } from "muppet-kit/tunnel";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

export default defineInspectorConfig({
	models: [openai("gpt-4.1-nano"), openai("gpt-4.1-mini")],
	tunneling: cloudflare(),
	// ... rest of your configuration
});
```
