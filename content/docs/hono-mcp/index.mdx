## Introduction

[@hono/mcp](npmjs.com/package/@hono/mcp) is a library that makes it easy to serve a MCP Server on [Honojs](https://hono.dev/). This way you can host your MCP server on all the platforms that Hono supports, such as Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Vercel, and more from the same codebase.

## Installation

You can install the `@hono/mcp` package using your preferred package manager.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} label='Install @hono/mcp'>

```bash tab="npm"
npm install @hono/mcp
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @hono/mcp
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn install @hono/mcp
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add @hono/mcp
```

</Tabs>

## Usage

In the below example, we create a simple Hono application that serves a MCP server. The MCP server can be accessed at the `/mcp` endpoint, and it uses the `StreamableHTTPTransport` to handle incoming requests.

```ts
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'
import { StreamableHTTPTransport } from '@hono/mcp'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

// Your MCP server implementation
const mcpServer = new McpServer({
  name: 'my-mcp-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
})

app.all('/mcp', async (c) => {
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPTransport()
  await mcpServer.connect(transport)
  return transport.handleRequest(c)
})

export default app
```

This transport is inspired by the [Official Model Context Protocol SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), but it is built from the ground up to work with Hono and its streaming capabilities, making it possible to use it in environments like Cloudflare Workers or Deno.
